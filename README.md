# Realtime-Apple-Lesions-detection-with-YOLO
Comparative research of models YOLOv5 and YOLOv6 and v7 in the Apple lesion data set. Alongside the effect of different annotation tech niches

The goal of this project is to predict plant’s disease from live camera stream. The first requirement 
is to create a dataset from the PLANTVILLAGE Dataset. The second requirement is to customize 
the YOLOV4 darknet model with this dataset, or the YOLOv5 whichever is the best performance. The third requirement is to create a web-based application that can detect plant’s disease from camera stream.

This is the report of the project.
